where are you, dreamcAtcher?
v1.0.0

you have been recently assigned the title of "dreamcatcher", and you wake up(?) somewhere strange.
use the arrow keys or double click the ghost to control movement.

originally made for a class project in 2022, adapted into ukagaka form in january-march and june-july 2025.
old lore has been updated from the old version, and a new visible map has been added (among other cute dialogue/qol ghost features, like not automatically closing upon completion.)
the old version is in base.txt.
